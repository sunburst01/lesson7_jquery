    The features I have added to enhance this display are  
when the user clicks the picture it toggles and says enjoy,
when the user hovers over the word ingredients and instructions the background becomes orange staying that way and then 
after that if the user hovers over that text it is yellow only while hovering,
also the text under instruction and ingredients toggles when the user clicks on it,
when the user first goes to the page the recipe name, apple pie stuffed cupcakes, slides and then comes back 
to its position above ingredients, then if you hover over that text it grows and becomes red staying that way.
